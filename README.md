# Counterfactual Routing Competition (CRC)

Welcome to the official repository for the [**Counterfactual Routing Competition (CRC)**](https://sites.google.com/view/crc25-ijcai/home), held at [IJCAI 2025](https://2025.ijcai.org/), the premier international conference for artificial intelligence research. CRC challenges participants to generate insightful, counterfactual explanations for personalized route planning.

>This competition is organised in the context of the European [PEER project](https://peer-ai.eu/en/), and includes organisers from the [municipality of Amsterdam](https://amsterdamintelligence.com/posts/creating-a-personalized-route-planner-for-less-mobile-people). The maps/graphs are based on real-world data and were created by the municipality of Amsterdam, using various techniques including point-cloud based obstacle and [width measurements](https://amsterdamintelligence.com/resources/accessible-sidewalk-width) and recognising suitable crossings from satellite imagery ([Link1](https://amsterdamintelligence.com/posts/where-not-to-cross-the-street), [Link2](https://bnaic2024.sites.uu.nl/wp-content/uploads/sites/986/2024/11/Where-Not-to-Cross-the-Street.pdf?)). The competition focuses on key AI components of explainable routing by providing counterfactual explanations, and its results may be used (attributed of course) in a demonstrator for accessible route planning. The competition is run open-source.

## About the Competition

The CRC is part of IJCAI 2025, taking place in Montreal, Canada, from August 16–22, 2025. For more details and updates, please visit the competition website: [https://sites.google.com/view/crc25-ijcai/rules-and-guidelines](https://sites.google.com/view/crc25-ijcai/rules-and-guidelines).

This competition focuses on explainable AI in the context of personalized route planning. Participants will be tasked with answering the following user-centric question:

> **"Why is the computed (fact) route optimal for me, and not the alternative (foil) route?"**

Your goal is to generate a *counterfactual map*: a minimally modified version of the original map where the foil route becomes optimal for the given user, according to their personalized preferences.

---

## Competition Format

Participants will be provided with:

- **A map**: The environment for route planning.
- **A route planner**: Computes optimal routes based on map and user preferences.
- **Start and destination locations**: The endpoints for routing.
- **A user model**: Encodes individual routing preferences (assumed correct for the competition).

**Key Concepts:**

- **Fact Route**: The optimal route for the user on the original map.
- **Foil Route**: An alternative route between the same start and destination.
- **Counterfactual Map**: A map as similar as possible to the original, where the foil route becomes optimal for the user.
- **Similarity**: Measured using a graph distance metric (details provided in the competition materials).
- **Map Operators**: The allowed modifications to the map for generating counterfactuals.

*Note*: Solutions where the foil route is nearly optimal (but not identical) may still be considered valid, as long as the changes are minimal and justified.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Baseline Solution

A baseline implementation using local search is provided in the repository:

- **Notebook**: `ls_demo.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates a simple approach for generating counterfactual maps. Participants are encouraged to use this as a starting point and improve upon it.
